# Thesis Review Summary

By rebalancing the portfolio in **Week 16**, we have sharpened our focus on high-impact, near-term catalysts while shoring up risk controls. We enter the coming weeks with three distinct biotech bets:

---

## 1. Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST)
**Highest-conviction position | Near-term binary catalyst – FDA decision (Dec 13)**

MIST epitomizes the portfolio’s swing for asymmetric rewards. The **December 13 FDA decision** for its PSVT nasal spray is a catalyst with the potential to dramatically boost our portfolio’s value if approved. We’ve done the homework: the CRL issues were addressed  
[ainvest.com](https://ainvest.com), and the therapy could fill a genuine unmet need in cardiology (treating rapid heart arrhythmias at home).  

At a ~$200M valuation, the market is skeptical, but we believe this is a classic case of a beaten-down micro-cap poised for a comeback.  

**Our thesis:** If the FDA greenlights etripamil, Milestone’s stock could multiply (analysts suggest a move to the teens per share on approval  
[ainvest.com](https://ainvest.com)). That would not only close our performance gap with the S&P, it could put us well ahead.  

We’ve allocated boldly here (~42% of portfolio) to maximize the benefit if our thesis proves correct – all while being mindful of the downside (a stop is in place, and position size is such that a total loss, while damaging, would not zero out the portfolio).

## 2. Spero Therapeutics (SPRO)
**Steady performer | Mid-term catalyst – NDA submission with GSK**

SPRO continues to anchor the portfolio with a somewhat lower-risk catalyst on the horizon. Its partnership with **GSK** and the upcoming **NDA submission for its oral antibiotic** give it a fundamentally strong foundation  
[biospace.com](https://biospace.com).  

We trimmed the position to fund MIST, but remain confident in SPRO’s value. This is the “slow-burn” catalyst in our basket: the stock may appreciate gradually as regulatory milestones are met (NDA filing acceptance, etc.) and as investors recognize the 2026 approval opportunity.  

Importantly, SPRO provides diversification: unlike MIST (which is binary in the next 2 months), SPRO’s catalyst is on a longer timeline and its downside is cushioned by its major pharma partner and solid cash runway.  

**Our thesis:** By the experiment’s end, we may not see explosive moves, but we expect a positive bias in the stock price as the NDA news comes out. Beyond this experiment, SPRO has all the hallmarks of a multi-bagger (a tiny cap addressing a large need with Big Pharma backing). For now, it remains a core hold, just right-sized.

## 3. Tiziana Life Sciences (TLSA)
**Innovative wild card | Thematic and momentum play**

TLSA’s **intranasal foralumab** is pioneering a new route of immunotherapy for neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases. Our thesis has been that Tiziana’s numerous “irons in the fire” (MS, ALS, Alzheimer’s, etc.) and its novel delivery method could attract increasing investor and possibly partner interest.  

The stock’s year-to-date performance (**+200%+**) and continued positive updates validate that thesis  
[nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) | [tizianalifesciences.com](https://tizianalifesciences.com).  

While TLSA won’t have a binary event during our experiment, we expect its strong news flow to continue – acting as a catalyst in its own right by keeping the stock on an upward trajectory.  

In the next weeks, any additional data or even speculation of a partnership (not uncommon for a company with such a platform) could lift the stock.  

We’ve kept the position smaller, reflecting its medium-term horizon, but view TLSA as a **high-upside, moderate-risk** component. It balances the portfolio by not being purely dependent on FDA decisions; it has a pipeline story that could independently create value.  

Our stop-loss will protect us in case momentum reverses, but otherwise we plan to ride the trend.  

**Thesis:** Tiziana’s approach could be paradigm-shifting (e.g., an MS therapy that is nasal rather than IV) – that promise should continue to attract investor attention into year-end, especially as micro-caps start to recover sector-wide.

## Summary

Our portfolio realignment leaves us with a concentrated yet, we believe, well-considered trio of positions.  

- **MIST:** Near-term binary catalyst (FDA decision)  
- **SPRO:** Mid-term catalyst with long-term multi-bagger potential (NDA/approval with GSK support)  
- **TLSA:** Innovative growth story (multiple trials and steady news flow)

All three trade at valuations that, in our analysis, do not fully price in their upside potential.  

We have effectively increased the portfolio’s **“beta” to biotech catalysts** – a necessary move given we are currently behind the benchmark (**$81.8 vs $105.6 from $100 start**) and have limited time to catch up  
[spotlightgrowth.com](https://spotlightgrowth.com).  

This comes with higher risk, but our **risk management tools** are in place:  
- Position sizing (three distinct bets)  
- Stop-loss orders  
- Diligent monitoring
