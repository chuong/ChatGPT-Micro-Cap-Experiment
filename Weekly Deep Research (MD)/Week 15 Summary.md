# Thesis Review Summary

As we enter **Week 14**, the portfolio is positioned squarely around **high-impact biotech catalysts**, with three holdings each representing a distinct facet of our strategy:

- **Near-term FDA Decision – Fortress Biotech (FBIO):**  
  This is our high-conviction event play. FBIO’s CUTX-101 for Menkes disease faces an FDA decision on **Sept 30**.  
  Our thesis is that CUTX-101 will win approval (supported by Breakthrough and priority review, strong efficacy in a rare pediatric disease), which could be game-changing for FBIO’s tiny ~$110M market cap.  
  We’ve slightly increased our stake in FBIO to amplify this potential asymmetric payoff. If successful, FBIO could surge (finally validating our catalyst-driven approach), while our preset stop limits the downside if the unexpected occurs.  
  This binary event will be the truest test of our strategy so far.

- **Medium-term Catalyst & Quality Asset – Aldeyra (ALDX):**  
  ALDX remains a core holding, embodying our “catalyst + buyout” theme.  
  Its dry eye drug’s **December PDUFA** and the optionality of a Big Pharma partnership (AbbVie) give it significant upside.  
  We expect a steady news flow into year-end – any indications of FDA favorability or AbbVie’s plans could re-rate the stock.  
  We trimmed a small portion solely for risk management, not due to loss of faith.  
  ALDX’s inclusion keeps our portfolio anchored in a slightly later catalyst, providing a follow-up opportunity after FBIO.  
  This staggered catalyst approach (Sept, then Dec) is intentional to potentially drive a second leg of portfolio gains.  
  **Thesis:** by Q4, if Reproxalap is approved (or Aldeyra is acquired), ALDX’s value could be many times our entry, rewarding our patience.

- **Turnaround with Pharma Backing – Spero Therapeutics (SPRO):**  
  Our new position in SPRO adds a strategic, lower-risk growth play to the mix.  
  SPRO’s partnership with **GSK** on its oral antibiotic positions it for likely FDA filing in the coming months and, by extension, a strong chance of approval given Phase 3 success.  
  The stock’s current depression (under $2) belies the tremendous progress and de-risking done via GSK’s involvement.  
  Our thesis is that as the market recognizes SPRO’s funded runway and impending NDA, the stock will climb (potentially well ahead of the actual approval).  
  SPRO diversifies our catalyst timeline (it may appreciate on filing news even before the formal FDA decision in 2026) and adds a fundamentally robust story to our portfolio.  
  It’s a classic “undervalued turnaround” that complements the pure catalyst plays in FBIO and ALDX.

In summary, the portfolio is now composed of **three micro-cap biotech bets** that each exemplify our experiment’s core idea: find small companies on the cusp of major catalysts or inflection points that can deliver outsized gains.  

The overall thesis – that a rebounding small-cap biotech market will reward catalytic events – still holds. We see increasing risk appetite in the sector, and our holdings are positioned to capitalize on that:  

- **FBIO** for an immediate binary win  
- **ALDX** for a medium-term approval/M&A  
- **SPRO** for a steadily building rerating with big pharma validation  

We have tight risk controls (stops in place, position sizes adjusted) to guard against the inherent volatility.

Going into next week, we are cautiously optimistic.  
The portfolio has been optimized with fresh research and a prudent shuffle of assets (trimming where prudent, adding where conviction is highest).  
Now, it’s about execution and monitoring.  

If our theses play out, the coming weeks could see a significant recovery in our performance (**currently at $85.22 vs ~$107 had we been in S&P 500**).  
We are prepared to adapt quickly as news comes in.  
The focus remains: stick to high-conviction catalysts, manage the risks, and aim for an asymmetric payoff that could close the gap with the benchmark by the experiment’s end.
